* Make multi-agent environment for self-play - check out TensorFlow RL agents & environment.
* Make lookAhead agent take into account bounds of board.
* Make GUI for better visuals and restarting the game.

* Update README.
* Train agent on larger board.
* Train good agents:
  * Understand different RL policies and policy gradient methods, and use best suited.
* Test RL reward functions and lookahead reward.
* Lookahead agent sucks at player 1 but great at player 2?

Progress all getting overwritten by player 2 training??

# Connect-Four-AI

#### This project is currently a work in progress!!!

# Aims

The aims of this repository are:
* Ensure that the entire project is created whilst adhering to proper coding practice and object-orientated programming.
* To eventually train an agent to play Connect Four against a human opponent.

# Connect Four

Connect four is a board game played between two people who take it in turns to drop a counter into one of, typically, 7 columns, each of whcih is usually 6 spaces high.
The aim is to be the first person to have a line of, typically, 4 counters in any horizontal, vertical or diagonal row.

# The AI

I hope to use some form of Reinforcement Learning algorithm, likely Q-Learning, to train an agent by making it play games against itself.

I understand that Connect Four is actually a very solvable game with the use of an efficient tree-search algorithm of all possible moves. 
However, the purpose of this is for me to develop my knowledge of reinforcement learning algorithms.

# Downloading

The easiest way to download the code is to press the download button on the home page of the GitHub repository.

# Use

The easiest way to use the program currently is to call it from the command line using:

```sh
python connectx/play.py
```

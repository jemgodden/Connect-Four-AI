# Connect-Four-AI

This project is currently a work in progress!

# Aims

The aim of this repository is to eventually train an agent to play Connect Four against a human opponent.
Another aim is to ensure tht the entier project is conducted via object-orientated programming.

# Connect Four

Connect four is a board game played between two people who take it in turns to drop a counter into one of, typically, 7 columns, each of whcih is usually 6 spaces high.
The aim is to be the first person to have a line of, typically, 4 counters in any horizontal, vertical or diagonal row.

# The AI

I hope to use some form of Reinforcement Learning algorithm, likely Q-Learning, to train an agent by making it play games against itself.

I understand that Connect Four is actually a very solvable game with the use of an efficient tree-search algorithm of all possible moves. 
However, the purpose of this is for me to develop my knowledge of reinforcement learning algorithms.

# Connect-Four-AI

### This project is currently a work in progress!

# Aims

The aims of this repository are:
* Ensure that the entire project is created whilst adhering to good coding practices and the object-orientated programming paradigm.
* Train an RL agent to play Connect Four against a human opponent.

# Next Steps

The next steps are:
* Combine the game code with the gym environment to allow the agent to play against a human opponent.
* Train further agents.

# Connect Four

Connect four is a board game played between two people who take it in turns to drop a counter into one of, typically, 7 columns, each of which is usually 6 spaces high.
The aim is to be the first person to have a line of, typically, 4 counters in any horizontal, vertical or diagonal row.

# The AI

I hope to use Reinforcement Learning algorithms, such as policy gradient methods, to train an agent by making it play games against other agents, or itself.

I understand that Connect Four is a solvable game with the use of an efficient tree-search algorithm of all possible moves. 
However, the purpose of this is for me to develop my knowledge of reinforcement learning algorithms.

# Downloading

The easiest way to download the code is to press the download button on the home page of the GitHub repository.

# Use

The easiest way to use the program currently is to call it from the command line using:

```sh
